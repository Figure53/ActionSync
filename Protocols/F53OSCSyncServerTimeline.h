/*
 
 The F53OSCSyncServerTimeline protocol allows a sync server to query any active timelines for their status.
 
 If you are hosting a F53OSCSyncServer, the timeline objects you register with it must implement this protocol. All methods are required.
 
 Furthermore, timeline objects should post NSNotifications with the name @"F53OSCSyncTimelineStateDidChange"; the server will observe those notifications and immediately query the timeline object for its state.
