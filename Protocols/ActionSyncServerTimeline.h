/*

 The ActionSyncServerTimeline protocol allows a sync server to query any active timelines for their status.

 If you are hosting a ActionSyncServer, the timeline objects you register with it must implement this protocol. All methods are required.

 Furthermore, timeline objects should post NSNotifications with the name @"ActionSyncTimelineStateDidChange"; the server will observe those notifications and immediately query the timeline object for its state.
